# about the project

Door Locker Security System consists of two ECUâ€™s. The first ECU called HMI responsible for interfacing with the user and the second ECU called control ECU which is responsible for the system operations and control. In the project I implemented the following drivers Keypad, LCD, DC Motor, UART, Timer, I2C and External EEPROM.



	> the master is connected to the keypad
	> the master is connected to the salve using UART 
	> the slave is connected with LCD, DC motor ( represent the door locker) 
	  and external EEPROM.
	> the EEPROM connected with the microcontroller using I2C
